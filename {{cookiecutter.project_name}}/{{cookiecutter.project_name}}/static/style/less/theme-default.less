    - It pulls in some theme dependant variables - a theme should only customize variables
    - It then pulls in that standard bootstrap.less file that has been altered like this:
        * Variables don't get imported because they have been already
        * Imports a custom mixins.less that in itself imports bootstrap's original mixins

    
    To make a new theme:
        - copy this file and name it "theme-<name-of-theme>.less"
        - copy the partials/variables-theme-default.less to partials/variables-theme-<name-of-theme>.less
          and change the theme-<name-of-theme>.less file accordingly.
